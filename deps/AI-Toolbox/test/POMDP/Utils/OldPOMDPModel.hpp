/**
 * @brief This class represents a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.
 *
 * This class inherits from any valid MDP model type, so that it can
 * use its base methods, and it builds from those. Templated inheritance
 * was chosen to improve performance and keep code small, instead of
 * doing composition.
 *
 * A POMDP is an MDP where the agent, at each timestep, does not know
 * in which state it is. Instead, after each action is performed, it
 * obtains an "observation", which offers some information as to which
 * new state the agent has transitioned to. This observation is
 * determined by an "observation function", that maps S'xAxO to a
 * probability: the probability of obtaining observation O after taking
 * action A and *landing* in state S'.
 *
 * Since now its knowledge is imperfect, in order to represent the
 * knowledge of the state it is currently in, the agent is thus forced
 * to use Beliefs: probability distributions over states.
 *
 * The way a Belief works is that, after each action and observation,
 * the agent can reason as follows: given my previous Belief
 * (distribution over states) that I think I was in, what is now the
 * probability that I transitioned to any particular state? This new
 * Belief can be computed from the Model, given that the agent knows
 * the distributions of the transition and observation functions.
 *
 * Turns out that a POMDP can be viewed as an MDP with an infinite
 * number of states, where each state is essentially a Belief. Since a
 * Belief is a vector of real numbers, there are infinite of them, thus
 * the infinite number of states. While POMDPs can be much more
 * powerful than MDPs for modeling real world problems, where
 * information is usually not perfect, it turns out that this
 * infinite-state property makes them so much harder to solve
 * perfectly, and their solutions much more complex.
 *
 * A POMDP solution is composed by several policies, which apply in
 * different ranges of the Belief space, and suggest different actions
 * depending on the observations received by the agent at each
 * timestep. The values of those policies can be, in the same way,
 * represented as a number of value vectors (called alpha vectors in
 * the literature) that apply in those same ranges of the Belief space.
 * Each alpha vector is somewhat similar to an MDP ValueFunction.
 *
 * @tparam M The particular MDP type that we want to extend.
